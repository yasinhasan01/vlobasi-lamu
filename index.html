            My love, I just wanted to take a moment to remind you how much you mean to me. Every day with you feels like a blessing, and I can’t imagine my life without your love, kindness, and warmth. You’re not just my wife; you’re my greatest inspiration and my safe haven. Thank you for being you—beautiful, strong, and endlessly amazing. <span style="color: pink;"><b>I love you</b></span> more than words can ever express.
